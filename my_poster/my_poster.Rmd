#### **INTRODUCTION**

* Due to off-target dicamba movement incidents during the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons, adoption of the Xtend technology (dicamba and glyphosate-tolerant soybeans) has become a controversial topic in the United States. 

* The **OBJECTIVE** of the survey was to understand Nebraska and Wisconsin stakeholdersâ€™ adoption and opinion related to the Xtend technology.

#### **MATERIAL AND METHODS**

##### **Survey**

* From August through September of 2018, a survey containing 22 questions related to soybean, dicamba and weed management was conducted in Nebraska and Wisconsin (Figure 1).

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 1. Survey questions of soybean production and dicamba use in Nebraska and Wisconsin.", out.width = '83%', fig.align="center", fig.retina = 2, fig.pos='h'}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/survey.png", dpi=600)
```

##### **Data analysis**

* Survey respondents as agronomist, co-op, university and industry representatives were grouped into **Decision influencer**.

* Data are presented as a % of responses from **decision influencer** and **farmer** of Nebraska and Wisconsin.

* Q4 is presented as the share of Xtend hectares compared to the total of soybean hactares reported in Q3; Q5 is the share of PRE-applied dicamba hectares compared to the total of Xtend hactares reported in Q4; Q6 is the share of POST-applied dicamba hectares compared to the total of Xtend hactares reported in Q4. 

* Data analysis was conducted in *R* statistical software using functions %>%, select, summarise, group, filter and mutate of **tidyverse** (ggplot, tidyr, dplyr) package. 

* Method loess (local polynomial) regression fitting was performed in Q4, Q5, and Q6 (Figures 4, 5, and 6).

#### **CONCLUSIONS**

* Faster adoption of the technology in Nebraska is likely due to bigger challenges faced with the widespread presence of herbicide-resistant weeds when compared to Wisconsin.

* In general, Nebraska and Wisconsin growers tended to be more conservative in their answers than decision influencers. 

* These survey responses will aid growers and decision influencers understand current and future adoption of the Xtend technology in the upper Midwest. 

* Further surveys regarding soybean production and dicamba use englobing additional states are necessary to better understand and document stakeholders adoption and opinion related to the Xtend technology.
