After using it the last two growing seasons and not having issues with it I won't be afraid to use it in the future if it is still available.  We need to continue finding ways to combat problem weeds like Waterhemp and Palmer Amaranth and Dicamba is one product that does work on them.

It is not the old days of spray roundup it will take care of everything.  I help producers and some of them don't understand that they spray some sort of dicamba on their corn and that is where the majority of the issues come from.  If people will start reading the labels and follow the regulations then we will have no problem.  I have heard multiple producers say that they don't want to use this product and wont plant the xtend beans because they don't want to be part of a lawsuit.

From the dying volunteer corn and curled palmer, it was sprayed mid-July.  The off-target movement in early June from corn and beans is not noticeable now, and probably helped canopy height!  If a grower sprays post early and follows the label, off-target movement is low and injuries are not yield related.  If anything should be done, the dicamba label for corn and beans should have a date.  After July 1, any dicamba sprayed is just asking for trouble.  I feel very strongly about the last statement."

The damage that I have seen in the past couple of years is very concerning to me. Especially after the problems last year. Along with cupped beans that have yield loss and are not able to canopy, I have also seen cupped tree leaves and cupped gardens. I thought maybe spray operators, farmers, agronomists, and anyone else that is responsible for dicamba being sprayed on fields would be a little more responsible. After having beans of my own cupped for the second year, I found that some people do not want to accept responsibility for the damage that they have likely caused and it turns into a blame game instead.   Here is just a sampling of the comments I have heard. They may not be word for word but you should get the idea of it rather quickly    - ""You should have planted extend beans""    - "" It was all the status that was sprayed on the corn""    - "" You better check and find out what all the neighboring fields were sprayed with""    - "" I followed the label ""    - "" It(dicamba damage) will make the beans yield better""  I am tired of having my beans damaged.(from enginia, fexapan, status, etc.)  I will likely report any damage I have next year. The worst part is calling the people that likely damaged my beans(in the real obvious cases). They never seem to call me first and do not like to admit any wrong doing. In the end I end up feeling like the bad guy. The real bad part is these are the same people I always see at the local coop, church, school, bank, equipment dealership, and the list goes on.   I was very shocked last year when the State of Nebraska did not step up and put some restrictions on dicamba use. The time is now to do something about this problem. I realize Palmer Amaranth is real hard to control, maybe all of the experts on dicamba can come up with a system that works and does not damage off target plants. Until then the volatile, unpredictable dicamba products should not be available for use. I should not have to be forced to plant dicamba tolerant beans to protect myself from dicamba.  "
